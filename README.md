**Tic-Tac-Toe** - tictactoe.py:
In this Python project, I learned how to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game where I compete against an AI. The game includes features such as me and the AI's turns, different difficulty levels (normal and hard), and the ability to continue or start a new game with a saved record of my wins and losses.
